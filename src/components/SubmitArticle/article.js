                  We invite new submissions of original work that we will
                  review, and if accepted, we will publish that article on our
                  website. To start this process, we ask you to do the
                  following. Put your article in a WORD doc and a PDF. Using the
                  form below, send both the WORD doc and the PDF to us. We will

                  your article given our comments on it; or (3) we will ask you
                  if we could publish it. If we ask you that we can publish it,
                  we will likely seek more information from you just to verify
